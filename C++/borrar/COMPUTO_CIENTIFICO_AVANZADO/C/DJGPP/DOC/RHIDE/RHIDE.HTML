There are two archives

<table border> <tr><td><code>rhide??b.zip</code><td> This contains the executables and the documentation for RHIDE running on DJGPP

<tr><td><code>rhide-?.?-1.i386.rpm</code><td> This is a RPM package with the binaries of RHIDE for Linux.

<tr><td><code>rhide??s.zip</code><td> This contains the sources of RHIDE for DJGPP.

<tr><td><code>rhide-?.?-1.src.rpm</code><td> This is a RPM package with the sources of RHIDE for Linux.

<tr></table>

NOTE: The sources for the Linux and DJGPP versions are of course in its core the same, there are only differences in the text-file formats (CR or CR/LF) and the project files differ and the DJGPP
sources contain some additional patches for the libc library to fix some known bugs there. But in general both archives can be used on both systems (after some cosmetic changes).  <p>

where <code>??</code> in the above filenames stand for the digits of the actual version of RHIDE.

<p>

These archives can be found at <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~rho/rhide.html">The RHIDE home page</a>.  (valid until at least 30. Sepetember 1997) or at any ftp site, which mirrors DJGPP.  <p>

The RPM packackes can be found at sunsite mirrors and/or also in some Linux distributions.  <p>

To install these archives, unzip them in the DJGPP-root directory, like any other DJGPP package.  <p>

To install the Linux RPM packages, use your favotite install program (most Linux distributions allow to install RPM packages) or install it with the Redhat package manager itself.  <p>

</MENU>
<A NAME="Configuring RHIDE">
<H4> 1.2.1 Configuring RHIDE </H4></A><P>
In most cases do nothing to configure RHIDE. But there are some special things, which must be configured which have mostly to do with the editor (or better) the keyboard layout.  <p>

The editor of RHIDE is configurable for the keyboard. For this it uses a text file <code>keybind.txt</code>, which is searched in the following directories (in that order). If it was not found in any
of these directories RHIDE uses builtin defaults. For more information about creating (customizing) the file and about the syntax of that file See <A HREF="editor.html#Keyboard">the "Keyboard"
section of the "SET's editor"</A>

<ul>
<li>The current directory
<li>The contents of the variable <samp>$(RHIDE_SHARE)</samp> it is set.
<li>The contents of the variable <samp>$(HOME)</samp> it is set.
<li><code>%DJDIR%/share/rhide</code>
</ul>
<p>

The binary archive of RHIDE includes already the config files for the US keyboard layout (<code>us.txt</code>) and many others, which are based on the Linux keytables. If you have problems with the
keyboard layout try to copy one of the files to <code>keybind.txt</code> (probably the one, which has a name similar to your country).  <p>

RHIDE also contains the file <code>keybind.txt</code> which IS <code>us.txt</code>.  <p>

As an example, if you are are using a German keyboard, and you have installed <code>keyb.com</code> as your keyboard driver program, you need to copy <code>de.txt</code> to <code>keybind.txt</code>
otherwise (for example) the keys <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd> are exchanged.  <p>

If you are using a keyboard driver (like I), which converts the scancodes of the keys (<code>keyb.com</code> does that NOT) you will probably not need the file <code>de.txt</code> (but the default
<code>keybind.txt</code>).  <p>

For configuring RHIDE on Linux (especially when running under X) See

<A HREF="#Running under Linux"> Running under Linux </A>

<A NAME="What is RHIDE?">
<H3> 1.3 What is RHIDE? </H3></A><P>
What is RHIDE? RHIDE is an Integrated Development Environment for compiling C- or C++-files (GNU-Assembler source files also supported) in an environment, which has an integrated editor where you can
edit your source files and a project management, where you can define, which files are needed to build a program or a library.  <p>

For what stands the name RHIDE? This has nothing mystic in it. It comes simply from my initials RH and IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  <p>

RHIDE works like the IDE from Borland, which comes with Turbo C++ 3.1 and is written with the Turbo Vision library, which I have ported to use with DJGPP. Features of this IDE are:
<ul>
<li> Syntax highlighting is now supported and you can customize all colors on your desktop.

<li> You can redirect the stdout and stderr from your program to a window in the IDE.

<li> You can generate a makefile for your project, so you can build the program also without the IDE.

<li> Most of the commandline options of GCC can be customized.

<li> You can also build a library instead of an executable.

<li> When saving a file to disk, the modification time of this file will be set to the time of the last modification in the editor.

<li> You can interrupt external programs (the compilers or your program) by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+Break</kbd> which are ignored by the IDE. That means also, that you cannot
interrupt the IDE by pressing these keys. If you want to enable this, compile the IDE without the <samp>-DNO_BREAK</samp>-flag.

<li> The integrated debugger. You can debug your program within RHIDE by executing each source line of your code and evaluating/modifying variables and expressions.

<li> You can define another compiler to compile your source files.

</ul>
<p>

In addition to RHIDE I have included a stand-alone debugger (called <code>rhgdb.exe</code>), which is GDB 4.16 with a Turbo Vision user interface.  <p>

<A NAME="Requirements">
<H3> 1.4 Requirements </H3></A><P>
RHIDE works under and is compiled with DJGPP V2.01.  To compile your programs you need a working GCC-configuration, that means, GCC must be found in your path. Because DJGPP works only under DPMI you
need a DPMI-Server.  If you run it under Windows 3.1(1)/95, you have DPMI. Under MS-DOS you need either a memory-manager, which give you DPMI-services (I think QEMM is it, EMM386 has no
DPMI-support), or you use CWSDPMI, the free DPMI-server from Charles W. Sandmann, which you can find on SimTel-ftp-sites. I use it and it works fine for me.  <p>

The builtin editor uses a simple heuristic to check, if a file is in UNIX or DOS text format. It checks the first 1024 Bytes, and if there is a lf without a cr, all lf's will be translated to
cr/lf's. This is done at first only in memory. But if you save your file to disk, it will be saved in DOS text format.  <p>

RHIDE will work correctly only with DJGPP version 2.01 or higher. If you have installed DJGPP 2.0, you will run into problems when the commandline passed to the called compilers or the linker will
exceed the 126 character limit. There is a new technique used from DJGPP 2.01 on, which programs compiled under 2.0 don't understand.  <p>

<A NAME="Getting started">
<H3> 1.5 Getting started </H3></A><P>
To run RHIDE type
<pre>

     rhide [options] ['file-name']

</pre>
or
<pre>

     rhide [options] 'project-name' [options]

</pre>
Here stands 'file-name', for a file, which you want to open at start up.  If it has no suffix it is assumed to be a 'project-name'.  <p>

'project-name' stands for a name of your project. If you don't type it, RHIDE searches the current directory for a project file. If there exists only one, it will be opened. If there exist more than
one or none, RHIDE will not open a project, you have to do it manually.  (See

<A HREF="#Open project"> Open project </A> ) <p>

Possible options are for debugging RHIDE itself (See

<A HREF="#Debugging RHIDE"> Debugging RHIDE </A> ).  If no project was open, you will see an empty desktop.  At the top-line of the screen you can see the menu. This is activated by pressing
<kbd>F10</kbd> or by clicking with the mouse at this line.  Alternatively you can press <kbd>Alt</kbd> plus the highlighted character of a pull-down menu, <i>e.g.</i> to activate the <em>File</em>
menu, press <kbd>Alt+F</kbd>. At the bottom is the status line with some hotkeys and their functions displayed.  <p>

Other options are:

<table border> <tr><td><samp>-H</samp><td> Do not install the console switch handler, which saves/restores the modified keyboard layout. This options works only when running under Linux.

<tr><td><samp>-S</samp><td> Tells RHIDE to use only 16bit access to the video memory under DJGPP, becuase some video cards cannot handle the 32bit access.

<tr><td><samp>-E</samp><td> Dump all variables known to RHIDE (the builtins and the real environment variables) to <code>stderr</code> end exit.

<tr><td><samp>-C</samp><td> Disable the handling of SIGINT

<tr><td><samp>-y</samp><td> Use long filenames (only under Windows 95)

<tr><td><samp>-n</samp><td> Do not use long filenames (only under Windows 95)

<tr><td><samp>-c</samp><td> Do not convert the case of any file name

<tr><td><samp>-h</samp><td> Show a short help about all the possible options.

<tr><td><samp>-b</samp><td> Use BIOS calls for setting and resetting the behavior of the 7th bit in a color attribute (blinking or 16 background colors) instead of direct outputs to the VGA registers.

<tr><td><samp>-k KEY_FILE</samp><td> The editor in RHIDE is now configurable also for the keyboard.  The file, where the key bindings are stored, is searched at first in the current directory; then
in the directory <code>%DJDIR%/data</code>; and then in the directory where the executable is. If all this fails default values are taken.  <p>

With this switch you can override the default name of <code>keybind.txt</code> to whatever you want.

<tr><td><samp>-p</samp><td> Normally RHIDE converts all the num-pad keys to the equivalent keys on the other keyboard (of course also by checking the <kbd>NumLock</kbd> key). With this switch you can
disable this.

<tr><td><samp>-G n</samp><td> Select which method is used for swapping the display. Currently there are two, little different functions implemented.  If you have problems with display swapping when
in graphics mode, try to use another method and see if that helps.

<tr><td><samp>-K</samp><td> Tell RHIDE, to use real BIOS calls for it's keyboard input. This is needed sometimes, when you have installed some special keyboard drivers.

<tr><td><samp>-M</samp><td> This tells RHIDE to not to install the mouse callback function for getting the mouse events. Instead of this RHIDE calls the mouse BIOS functions for getting any event of
the mouse. This option should be used mainly when running under Windows NT (but there I select this now automatically by default)

<tr></table>

At the upper right corner of the screen you can see the free virtual/physical memory (where M stands for Megabytes, K for Kilobytes and B for Bytes), if enabled (See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ).  <p>

If you try to open a project, which does not exist, RHIDE will create a new one.  The way for creating a new project is done by RHIDE as follows.  If there exist in the directory of RHIDE (usually in
%DJDIR%/bin) a project file with the root name of the executable and the suffix <code>.gpr</code>, this file is copied as your new project file with all customizations, which you have done in it. If
this standard project file doesn't exist, a new project file is created with the hardcoded defaults.  <p>

To create such a standard project file, change to the directory where the executable is and call the exe-file with the argument of its name without the suffix <code>.exe</code>. After leaving the
program, the standard project file is created.  <p>

There is also support for multiple languages. For this RHIDE uses the GNU gettext library. With this lib it is possible to support multiple languages without changing any code of RHIDE, when adding a
new language.  <p>

There are two ways for selecting the language. Either you set the environment variable <var>LANGUAGE</var> to the language you want or give it as a commandline argument to RHIDE. The normal way is by
setting <var>LANGUAGE</var>. If you have installed RHIDE as described in the <code>readme</code>, you should specify the language with a two character shortcut. Here is the list of the current
supported languages together with the two character code:

Because it was not possible to get all the translations at the time when RHIDE was ready, I included only the message files (that are the files with the <code>.mo</code> suffix) as they are ready in

<A NAME="Debugging RHIDE">
<H4> 1.5.2 Debugging RHIDE </H4></A><P>
I have added some commandline options to debug the IDE itself. These options are the following:

<table border>

<tr><td><samp>-dt</samp><td> Do not remove the temporary files which the IDE creates. The names of these files will be printed to stderr.

<tr><td><samp>-dc</samp><td> Print to <code>stderr</code> the commands which the IDE executes.

<tr><td><samp>-dd</samp><td> Print to <code>stderr</code> how the IDE checks the dependencies.

<tr><td><samp>-df</samp><td> Print to <code>stderr</code> how the IDE searches for files.

<tr><td><samp>-ds</samp><td> Print to <code>stderr</code> how the IDE expands the specs.

<tr><td><samp>-da</samp><td> Turns on all of the above

<tr></table>

You can also combine these options like <samp>-dct</samp>, which is the same as <samp>-dc -dt</samp>.  <p>

To examine this debugging information, it is the best to use the redir command, to redirect the stderr to a file like
<pre>

     redir -e err rhide -da project

</pre>
which will redirect stderr to the file <code>err</code>.  <p>

Each of the letters above (after <samp>-d</samp>) can be prefixed by a <samp>-</samp> or a <samp>+</samp> to explicitely turn the flag on or off.  For instance <samp>-dc</samp> and <samp>-d+c</samp>
are the same and <samp>-da-c</samp> selects all debugging options except the <samp>-dc</samp> switch.  <p>

If you want to supply certain switches for RHIDE as a default, you may put them into the environment variable <samp>$(RHIDEOPT)</samp>.  The contents of this variable is used before the the real
commandline is parsed.  That means you can overwrite the switches from the environment variable.  <p>

<A NAME="The program GPR2MAK.EXE">
<H3> 1.6 The program GPR2MAK.EXE </H3></A><P>
This program can be used to create a makefile from your project-file.  It does exactly the same as the function which is selectable from the RHIDE menu (See

<A HREF="#Write Makefile"> Write Makefile </A> ).  <p>

In RHIDE you have only the possibility to say, if in the generated makefile all dependencies should be included or not. With <code>gpr2mak.exe</code> you can tell also to create recursively all the
needed makefiles. This makes sense only if you have included other projects in your project.  <p>

Here are the possible commandline options for <code>gpr2mak.exe</code>.  <table border> <tr><td><samp>-d</samp><td> Include all dependencies in the makefile

<tr><td><samp>-d-</samp><td> Include only the needed dependencies to create the final program or library.

<tr><td><samp>-r</samp><td> Call <code>gpr2mak.exe</code> recursively, if there are other projects part of the project.

<tr><td><samp>-r-</samp><td> Do not call <code>gpr2mak.exe</code> recursively.

<tr><td><samp>-o OUTFILE</samp><td> Use <samp>OUTFILE</samp> instead of the project name (with the suffix <code>.mak</code>) as the created makefile. If you want to write the makefile to
<code>stdout</code>, use <samp>-</samp> as <samp>OUTFILE</samp>.

<tr></table>

And the complete syntax for calling <code>gpr2mak.exe</code> is also:

<pre>

     gpr2mak.exe [-d[-]] [-r[-]] [-o OUTFILE] project-file

</pre>
<p>

If you give no options, (the project-file must be given), <code>gpr2mak.exe</code> assumes the flags <samp>-d- -r-</samp> as default.  <p>

<H4> 1.7.1 What are these so called projects </H4></A><P>
A project for RHIDE is a file, which contains all the needed information required to build a program or library from one or more source files. Also all the other options which belong to the look and
feel of your desktop are stored there.  <p>

In general RHIDE creates for each project two files. One for the project itself (it has the suffix <code>.gpr</code>) and one for the desktop related things (it has the suffix <code>.gdt</code>).  <p>

To create a new project either run rhide with a not existing project name as argument or open within RHIDE a project by selecting a name which is not existent.  <p>

<A NAME="Creating your first project">
<H4> 1.7.2 Creating your first project </H4></A><P>
For the next instructions I will assume, that you want to create a project for the standard "Hello world" program in the current directory. Create now the new project by running

<pre>

     rhide hello

</pre>
and you will see an empty desktop and one window opened, the project window.  This window will show you that there is no file defined for your project.  If the project window is selected, (it has a
double frame), then hit there <kbd>Ins</kbd> and you will be prompted for adding an item to your project.  <p>

Type in the input line now <code>hello.c</code> and hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. Now hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> to leave the dialog. You will see now, that the project window contains a line with
<code>hello.c</code>.  <p>

Now hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on that filename and you will get an empty editor window named <code>hello.c</code> prepended by the current directory. In this editor window you can type now the program:

<pre>

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello world!\n");
  exit(0);
}

</pre>
Now you can select from the Run-menu the Run entry (or use the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl+F9</kbd>) and RHIDE will do all the necessary steps to compile, link and execute the program.  <p>

If everything was correct (no typing errors) or some other error, you will get a message box where RHIDE tells you, that the program exited with an exit code of 0. (This is the value, which you have
specified in your program above in the <code>exit(0);</code> statement) This box you can close with <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or <kbd>ESC</kbd>.  <p>

To see the output of the program, you can switch now to the user screen with <kbd>Alt+F5</kbd> or from the menu (Windows/User screen).  To return back to RHIDE hit any key.  <p>

<A NAME="Environment variables">

RHIDE uses many environment variables for it's configuration and behavior. This includes also some standard variables, which are used by the in RHIDE linked libraries. These are:

<table border> <tr><td>$(LOCALEDIR)<td> This should point to the directory, where your locale files are stored. If it is not set, RHIDE tries to get the system default value, which is for Linux
<code>/usr/share/locale</code> and for DJGPP <code>$(DJDIR)/share/locale</code>.

<tr><td>$(INFOPATH)<td> This is a pathlist of directories, where your INFO files are stored. If not set, RHIDE tries the standard directory, which should for Linux <code>/usr/info</code> and for
DJGPP <code>$(DJDIR)/info</code>.

<tr><td>$(RHIDEOPT)<td> This variable can be used, to define global RHIDE commandline options. The value of this variable is used, as if the contents are given on commandline before any of the real
commandline options. Which means, they can be overwritten on the commandline.

<tr><td>$(ESCDELAY)<td> This variable is used <em>ONLY</em> in the Linux version, where it defines the delay after pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> to wait for another keypress to simulate an <kbd>Alt</kbd>
keycode. The value is given in milliseconds and defaults to 1000.

<tr><td>$(LANGUAGE)<td> This variable is used to specify the language, in which RHIDE should communicate with you. The contents of this variable should be the ISO 2-character code of your country.

<A NAME="Setting environment variables for RHIDE">
<H4> 1.8.1 Setting environment variables for RHIDE </H4></A><P>
There are some different ways for setting environment variables for RHIDE. One of them is to set them like any other environment variable on your system. But this means that these variables are
visible also by all the other programs.  <p>

When using the DJGPP version, you can set them in your <code>djgpp.env</code> file either at the beginning as global variables for any DJGPP program or in a special section <samp>[RHIDE]</samp> only
for RHIDE. Please read the doc about the format of the <code>djgpp.env</code> file for more information.  <p>

Derived from the technique used on DJGPP for setting environment variables which are visible only for DJGPP programs, I have added in RHIDE a similar thing. RHIDE can read environment variables also
from a file called <code>rhide.env</code>.  <p>

The syntax of this file is very simple. Each line has one of the following syntax: <table border> <tr><td>VARIABLE=CONTENTS<td> Which means, that the environment variable <samp>VARIABLE</samp> should
become the contents <samp>CONTENTS</samp> where <samp>CONTENTS</samp> can be also a variable, which is expanded at runtime.

<tr><td>.OTHER_ENV_FILE<td> Such a line (it begins with a dot) tells RHIDE to read in at that point the file <code>OTHER_ENV_FILE</code> as environment file. The name <code>OTHER_ENV_FILE</code> can
be also an environment variable, which is expanded before reading the file.

<tr><td># comments<td> A line, which begins with a <samp>#</samp> means, that this line is ignored.  It can be used for you to write there some comments about that file.

<tr><td>!VARIABLE=CONTENTS<td> This is the same syntax as without the ! at the beginning of the line but it tells RHIDE to place the variable also in the environmen so also other programs (called by
RHIDE) can see this variable.

<tr></table>

RHIDE is very powerful in handling the environment variables. Most of it is taken from the behavior of GNU make. On this great things depend, that a variable name can consist also of other variables,
which are computed when the variable should be expanded.  <p>

As an example of this, you can take a look on the RHIDE sources in the <code>rhide.env</code> files. There I'm using, for instance, the RHIDE builtin variable $(RHIDE_OS) to define the libraries,
which are linked in RHIDE depending on the operating system where RHIDE is built.  <p>

An other example is distributed with RHIDE in it's binary archives as <code>rhide_.env</code> which is commented and should be in a directory <code>.../share/rhide/</code> where the <code>...</code>
stand for a different directory on different OS's. (on DJGPP it is %DJDIR% and on Linux it is /usr/local ) <p>

Here is a part of the environment file <code>rhide.var</code> in the main RHIDE source directory (which is included by <code>rhide.env</code> with
<pre>

.$(RHIDESRC)/rhide.var

</pre>
<pre>

RHIDE_OS_LIBS_Linux=ncurses gpm m
RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_idegc.exe=dbg
RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP=$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_$(MAIN_TARGET))
RHIDE_OS_LIBS=$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS))

</pre>
The RHIDE builtin linker spec (See

<A HREF="#Builtin compiler specs"> Builtin compiler specs </A> ) includes also $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS) when linking. Since RHIDE can be built on DJGPP and Linux and on these different operating systems I
have to link different libraries.  <p>

Description of the above: When linking on DJGPP the file <code>idegc.exe</code> (which is RHIDE) I have to include (in addition to all the other libraries) <code>libdbg.a</code>, which contains all
the DJGPP specific debugging functions. This is done at runtime by expanding RHIDE_OS_LIBS. Here are the steps, how RHIDE expands the variable RHIDE_OS_LIBS:

<pre>

$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS)                      ->  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS))
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS))          ->  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP)
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP)                ->  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_$(MAIN_TARGET))
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_$(MAIN_TARGET)) ->  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_idegc.exe)
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_idegc.exe       ->  dbg

</pre>
In a similar way it expands on Linux to

<pre>

$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS) -> ncurses gpm m

</pre>
<A NAME="Where to store the environment file">
<H4> 1.8.2 Where to store the environment file </H4></A><P>
RHIDE searches some known directories for the file <code>rhide.env</code> (and of course also other there defined included files).  <p>

At first it searches for a global file in <code>/usr/local/share/rhide</code> (on Linux) or <code>$(DJDIR)/share/rhide</code>. Then it searches in <code>$(HOME)</code> and at last in the current
directory.  <p>

RHIDE does not only a search, it also loads the file, if it was found in any of the above mentioned directories. That means, if in all these directories <code>rhide.env</code> exists, it is loaded.
This has the effect, that you can define some global defaults which can be overwritten with a <code>rhide.env</code> in the current or your home directory.  <p>

<A NAME="General information about how RHIDE works"> <CENTER>
<H2> 2. General information about how RHIDE works </H2></A><P>
</CENTER>
In this section I will give you some comments about the concept of RHIDE.  RHIDE works with the GNU compilers. As a result of this, most of the options are fixed and they are mostly also specific
only for this compiler. If I speak about compilers, I mean GCC, which calls the right compilers for you.  (<code>cpp</code> for preprocessing your input files, <code>cc1</code> for compiling C
programs, <code>cc1plus</code> for compiling C++ programs and <code>as</code> for compiling assembler files and so on) <p>

Selecting the right compiler for a specific file is done by RHIDE in the same way as GCC does it. It looks for the extension of the file and determines the language of this file.  <p>

<A NAME="Syntax of arguments">
<H3> 2.2 Syntax of arguments </H3></A><P>
In RHIDE you can specify some arguments to other programs. These arguments must be a space separated list of strings. If you want to have one or more spaces as part of an argument, you have to
enclose the whole argument in single or double quotes.  <p>

<A NAME="Running under Windows 95">
<H3> 2.3 Running under Windows 95 </H3></A><P>
With DJGPP 2.01 were many bugs fixed, which caused problems under Windows 95 with the long (and case sensitive) filenames. Now all filenames are shown in lower case, except they contain characters
with different case. That means, all normal 8+3 DOS filenames, which are normally reported in Windows 95 in upper cases, are automatically converted to lower case. For more information about filename
conversion look at the libc reference.  <p>

If you really need the filenames exactly as they are reported by the OS, you can use the <var>-c</var> switch (See

<A HREF="#Getting started"> Getting started </A> ).  <p>

You can also run more than one instance of RHIDE at once, in several DOS-boxes, because RHIDE creates and uses its own temp directory every time it starts to disable conflicts, when running multiple
compilers at the same time. This is done by creating a directory in the directory pointed at by the environment variables %TMPDIR%, %TEMP% or %TMP%, in that order, until one of them exists. If none
of them exists, the current directory is assumed. Then RHIDE puts the value of this directory into the environment variable %TMPDIR%. After leaving RHIDE this directory will be removed, if it is
empty.  <p>

<A NAME="Running under OS/2">
<H3> 2.4 Running under OS/2 </H3></A><P>
Because I have no access to OS/2, I cannot say anything about it. But some people said that they run RHIDE under OS/2 successfully, but there must be the exclusive mouse access to the DOS window
disabled.  <p>

Since RHIDE is now available also for Linux here some hints. In general you will get the best results when you have installed RHIDE as a setuid root program. I know, this might be a security problem
but I have tried to make it as secure as possible. After getting acces to the screen and the keyboard RHIDE will switch back to your normal rights and does not use root rights any more. It does not
write any data or modify any file on disk with root rights (except you are running as root of course).  <p>

The reason for this is the rudimentary support for fast access to the screen and the totally hided acces to the keyboard in the Linux kernel.  Additionally when you want to use the dual monitor
debugging feature of RHIDE this is also needed, because RHIDE needs in that case access to the ports of your monochrome video card.  <p>

Running RHIDE under X-Window is not full supported (but it is possible).  There are several reasons for this. The first is, that RHIDE uses in that case only terminal functions for input and output.
That means it depends completetly on your terminfo database and these are (at least for me) in some cases totally wrong. You can see this mostly that RHIDE does not handle correct the keyboard. Other
programs which use ncurses know this also and have there own hardcaded patches but I do not want to do so.  <p>

To fix the keyboard conflicts whenrunning in a xterm, I distribute little modified terminfo file <code>/usr/local/share/rhide/xterm-rhide</code> which you can place in
<code>/usr/lib/terminfo/x</code> or when you have no root access you can place it also in <code>$HOME/.terminfo/x</code>.  And then to use this file simply set the environment variable to this new
terminal with
<pre>

  export TERM=xterm-rhide

</pre>
before running RHIDE in the xterm.  <p>

An other alternative is to run RHIDE in a rxvt terminal but there you have to set also explicitely the TERM variable, because it is set mostly to xterm-color.
<pre>

  export TERM=rxvt

<A NAME="Creating a program">
<H4> 2.7.1 Creating a program </H4></A><P>
For creating a program, RHIDE allows you to define multiple source files which should be compiled and linked to your final program. This is done by creating a project. In this project you insert your
source files (and not all the include files).  <p>

After a source file (which is inserted in your project) compiled at least once, RHIDE knows about all dependencies of this file, so this file will be compiled again only, if one of the include files
have changed.  <p>

<p>
<MENU>

</MENU>
<A NAME="Creating a program without a project">
<H4> 2.7.1.1 Creating a program without a project </H4></A><P>
Because of many requests of users I made RHIDE to work also without using a project. This may be good, if you have a single file, but if your program should be build from more than one file I suggest
you to use a project.  <p>

If you have only one editor window opened, the name of the resulting program is taken from the name of the source file by removing the suffix and on DJGPP appending <code>.exe</code>.  <p>

If you have more than one files opened, I saw no other way for determining the name of the produced program, than naming it <code>aout</code> (on DJGPP <code>aout.exe</code>).

<A NAME="Creating a library">
<H4> 2.7.2 Creating a library </H4></A><P>
You can also create libraries (a collection of object files, which can be linked with other programs) with RHIDE. The way for doing this is very simple. Because RHIDE knows about the meaning of file
suffixes, you can change the name of the main target (See

<A HREF="#Main targetname"> Main targetname </A> ) to have a suffix <code>.a</code> and that's all. Now RHIDE will run <code>ar</code> instead of linking.

<p>

<A NAME="Saving/Loading the options">
<H4> 2.7.3 Saving/Loading the options </H4></A><P>
RHIDE supports two different ways for saving the options which you have customized.  <p>

The first one (which I prefer) is the use of the so called default project. This is the project <code>rhide.gpr</code> and must be located in the same directory where <code>rhide.exe</code> is. To
create or modify this default project change to that directory (normally %DJDIR%/bin) and type there

<pre>

     rhide rhide

</pre>
Now change any options you want and exit RHIDE. From now on these options are used for any newly created project or when running RHIDE without a project.  <p>

The second way is to save your options to a project file (See

<A HREF="#Save options"> Save options </A> ) or to load them from any existing project file (See

<A HREF="#Load options"> Load options </A> ).  <p>

<A NAME="FSDB">
<H4> 3.1.3 FSDB </H4></A><P>
With this menu item you can call the FSDB debugger, which comes with DJGPP. But remember, this runs the debugger as an external program and it is not integrated in RHIDE.  <p>

<A NAME="GREP">
<H4> 3.1.4 GREP </H4></A><P>
This is a very useful function. You can type the arguments for grep in the input line, which will be shown, and after this the program grep is called. The messages from grep are redirected to the
message window (See

<A HREF="#Message window"> Message window </A> ).  <p>

<A NAME="GDB">
<H4> 3.1.5 GDB </H4></A><P>

<A NAME="Refresh Desktop">
<H4> 3.1.6 Refresh Desktop </H4></A><P>
This function is sometimes useful, if you had run your program and it wrote some things to the screen (for redirecting <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> from your program to a window in
RHIDE (See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> )).  <p>

<A NAME="Calculator">
<H4> 3.1.7 Calculator </H4></A><P>
This brings up a dialog, where you can do some calculations. This dialog is similar to the evaluate dialog (See

<A HREF="#Evaluate/Modify"> Evaluate/Modify </A> ), but it uses not the feature of GDB, but it is a separate calculator.  For more information See <A HREF="editor.html#Calculator">the "Calculator"
section of the "SET's editor"</A> <p>

There can be used also some of the standard functions like <samp>log</samp>, <samp>sin</samp> and so on and it can convert also integer values between different bases (<samp>hex</samp>,
<samp>oct</samp>, <samp>dec</samp>).  <p>

Brings up the file-open dialog, where you can select a file to open (hotkey <kbd>F3</kbd> ). This dialog contains an input line for the filename, a list of filenames, an information window and the
buttons for opening and canceling.  <p>

In the filename input line you can type directly the file, which you want to open or you can type any mask to list only some files. The default mask is <code>*.cc</code>, but you can change this to
anything and your last typed mask is stored as the default mask for the next use. There is also a history of your previous typed inputs available. This is selected when you hit the down key or click
at the small symbol at the end of the input line with your mouse.  <p>

The list of filenames shows all the files that correspond to the mask.  If this list is selected you can choose a file with the cursor keys, or you can type the first letters of the filename you
want, and the bar is located at the first file, which has these letters as the first characters. To open the file simply press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or double click with the mouse on it.  <p>

Below the list of filenames there is a small window with information about the selected file (complete path, size, modification time).  <p>

To leave the dialog without opening a file press <kbd>ESC</kbd> .  <p>

<A NAME="New">
<H4> 3.2.2 New </H4></A><P>
This is the menu entry for creating a new file to edit. This file gets the title 'Untitled'. If you save or close it, you will be prompted for a new name of this file by opening the file-open dialog.
<p>

<A NAME="Save">
<H4> 3.2.3 Save </H4></A><P>
Save the file in the current editor-window to disk. If the name of the current file is 'Untitled' you will be prompted for a new name. <kbd>F2</kbd> is the hotkey for this function.  The modification
of the file on disk is set to the time of the last modification of this file and not to the time when saving to disk.  <p>

If the file was not modified, it is not saved!!  <p>

<A NAME="Save as">
<H4> 3.2.4 Save as </H4></A><P>
Save the file in the current editor-window to disk under a different name, for which you will be prompted. For choosing the new name the file-open dialog will be opened.  <p>

<A NAME="Save all">
<H4> 3.2.5 Save all </H4></A><P>
Save all the editor files to disk. If they are not modified, they will not be saved.  <p>

<A NAME="DOS Shell">
<H4> 3.2.6 DOS Shell </H4></A><P>
This executes a DOS-Shell. This is done by calling the program, which is set in the environment variable COMSPEC. If this variable does not exist, the program <code>c:/command.com</code> is executed.
To return to the IDE type <kbd>exit</kbd> at the DOS-prompt. Before calling DOS, the program does a <em>Save all</em> (See

<A HREF="#Save all"> Save all </A> ) automatically.  <p>

<A NAME="Exit">
<H4> 3.2.7 Exit </H4></A><P>

<A NAME="Make">
<H4> 3.6.2 Make </H4></A><P>
This makes your project up to date. It works like MAKE on commandline with a makefile. <kbd>F9</kbd> is the hotkey. The dependencies are checked for each item of the project. These dependencies are
automatically generated, if you compile a file within the IDE.  <p>

<A NAME="Link">
<H4> 3.6.3 Link </H4></A><P>
This function has two different results depending on the type of your project. If your project is an executable (See

<A HREF="#Known suffixes"> Known suffixes </A> ), the linker is started. But if it is a library, all the object files are taken to build a library.  <p>

<A NAME="Disassembler window">
<H4> 3.7.5 Disassembler window </H4></A><P>
This opens a window, where you can see assembler instructions.  When you are running the debugger, you will see the instructions at the current execution point of your program.  <p>

You can step See

<A HREF="#Step over"> Step over </A>  or trace See

<A HREF="#Trace into"> Trace into </A>  here in the same way like in an editor window and you can also debug code, which has no debugging information.  <p>

Additionally you can scroll here also forwards or backwards but scrolling backwards is very hard to implememnt and so you will get when scrolling backwards most of the time wrong output. Sorry for
this, but until I find more time to implement this better you have to live with it.  <p>

<A NAME="Call stack">
<H4> 3.7.6 Call stack </H4></A><P>
This shows a window with a list of functions, from which the current execution point in the debugged program is called. If you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a function which has line number debugging
information, you will go to the source line which is shown in the window.  <p>

(<kbd>Ctrl+F3</kbd> is the hotkey.)

<A NAME="List of Functions">
<H4> 3.7.7 List of Functions </H4></A><P>
This asks first for a regular expression to list only those functions of your program, which match that expression. The syntax for such a regular expression is a little bit different from the
wildcards you are probably knowing from MS-DOS.  <p>

If you want to get a list of all functions you should enter either nothing (the default), or ".*", or "?*" (both without the double quotes).  The expression "*" does NOT mean all function. In fact,
your entry will be interpreted as a regular expression.  <p>

After you have typed the expression and pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you will get a list of functions that match the regular expression and for which debugging information is available.  <p>

This list is sorted by the name of the function and has three parts:

<pre>

NAME | RETURN VALUE | FILE

</pre>
You can walk through the list with the cursor keys or the mouse. If you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or double click a function, you will go the the source code of that function.  <p>

<A NAME="Open project">
<H4> 3.8.1 Open project </H4></A><P>
Here is the point to open a project. After selecting this menu item, the file open dialog is opened to select a project. You can type the name of the project or select one from the list.  <p>

If you open a project in another directory than the current, RHIDE will change the current directory to this directory and then the project will be opened.  <p>

If you type here a name of a project which does not exist, a new one is created.  <p>

If no project was opened and you create a new project, all open desktop files remain open, but they are not added to the project.  If a project was opened, it will be automatically closed before the
new project is opened.  <p>

<A NAME="Close project">
<H4> 3.8.2 Close project </H4></A><P>
This closes the currently opened project and closes all files, which are on the desktop.  <p>

<A NAME="Add item">
<H4> 3.8.3 Add item </H4></A><P>
A dialog will be opened, from where you can choose your file to add to your project. If you are in the project window (See

<A HREF="#Project window"> Project window </A> ) you can use the <kbd>Ins</kbd> key to activate this function within the project window.  <p>

Currently it is impossible to use relative or absolute paths as part of a project item. If you have your files in several directories, you have to setup either the search path for source files or you
have to create for each directory a library that can be included in your project.  <p>

<A NAME="Delete item">
<H4> 3.8.4 Delete item </H4></A><P>
This will remove the selected item in the project-window from your project. If you are in the project window (See

<A HREF="#Project window"> Project window </A> ) you can use the <kbd>Del</kbd> key to activate this function.  <p>

<A NAME="Local options">
<H4> 3.8.5 Local options </H4></A><P>
Here you can give the selected project-item options for compiling, which will be in effect only for this item. If you are in the project window (See

<A HREF="#Project window"> Project window </A> ) you can use <kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd> to activate this function.  The options you give here are passed to GCC only, when compiling this file.  For more
details see (See

<A HREF="#Local options for a project item"> Local options for a project item </A> ).  <p>

<A NAME="Includes">
<H4> 3.8.6 Includes </H4></A><P>
This shows the dependencies for the selected item in the project window. You can use the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd> in the project window.  (See

<A HREF="#Project window"> Project window </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="Main targetname">
<H4> 3.8.7 Main targetname </H4></A><P>
Here you can change the name of your main target. The main target is either an executable file or a library. RHIDE selects the type of the main target from the suffix of this name. If it has no
suffix or the suffix <code>.exe</code>, an executable will be built. If it has the suffix <code>.a</code>, a library will be created.  <p>

Remember when you give it no suffix, both, the COFF image and the <code>.exe</code> file will created. If it has the <code>.exe</code> suffix, only the <code>.exe</code> file is created.  <p>

<A NAME="Primary file">
<H4> 3.8.8 Primary file </H4></A><P>
Here you can give the primary source file, when you want to use the 'automake' feature of GPC. If you type a source name here, RHIDE assumes that your program is written in Pascal and does NOT check
any dependencies of the project, because this is done automatically by GPC with the <samp>-automake</samp> option.  <p>

If you don't want to use the 'automake' feature of GPC, even when building a Pascal program, give here an empty name, which is the default.  <p>

<A NAME="Clear dependencies">
<H4> 3.8.9 Clear dependencies </H4></A><P>
This function removes all internal stored dependencies. The files are not removed. This is useful when you want to create a makefile (See

<A HREF="#Write Makefile"> Write Makefile </A> ) and you do not want to include all the absolute filenames for the dependencies (mostly the include files).  <p>

This function is a relict from earlier versions of RHIDE, but I have not disabled it.  <p>

<A NAME="Delete rebuildable files">
<H4> 3.8.10 Delete rebuildable files </H4></A><P>
This function includes the function of clearing the dependencies (See

<A HREF="#Clear dependencies"> Clear dependencies </A> ) and removes in addition to it all the files, which can be rebuild within RHIDE.  <p>

<A NAME="Write Makefile">
<H4> 3.8.11 Write Makefile </H4></A><P>
Here you can create a makefile that contains all the rules to build the project from the command line without starting RHIDE. For this you need the GNU make, because the generated makefile uses the
features of GNU make very extensively.  <p>

If you have used environment variables in your search paths (See

<A HREF="#Directories"> Directories </A> ), these are not expanded in the generated makefile.  But all variables you used will be defined at the beginning of the makefile with their current value.

All the paths you can define in the several entries have the form of a semicolon separated list of directories, just like your environment variable %PATH%. You can use forward slashes and back
slashes, but they are all converted to forward slashes by RHIDE. You can also use environment variables as part of your paths. The syntax of such a variable is that of a GNU makefile. If you want to
use the variable <var>%DJDIR%</var>, you must type <var>$(DJDIR)</var>.  <p>

The options in the dialogs for Warnings, Debugging, C-flags and CXX-Flags are selected with the cursor-keys or the mouse and are activated or deactivated by pressing <kbd>SPACE</kbd> or by
double-clicking with the mouse at the first field of the option. If an option can take an additional value or string, an inputbox will be opened, and you can type them there. If the additional value
is optional, you can leave this input-box by pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> or activating the <em>Cancel</em> button and no value, or the previous one will be appended to this option.  <p>

<A NAME="Libraries">
<H4> 3.9.3 Libraries </H4></A><P>
Here you can tell the linker which libraries will be linked in your program. At this time the number of additional libraries is limited to 16. If you need more, you have to type them manually (See

<A HREF="#Linker options"> Linker options </A> ).  <p>

In the input-fields of the dialog you only have to type the part of your library name after <code>lib</code> and before <code>.a</code>. Example: If your library is <code>libtv.a</code> put only
<code>tv</code> there. You can switch between the input lines for the libraries using <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> (next field) or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> (previous
field). If you have typed your libraries you can activate or disable them by switching the checkbox before the name on or off. This is done by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> and the corresponding digit or
letter of the checkbox at the same time or by clicking with the mouse.  <p>

Normally RHIDE checks the types of your source-files and automatically adds some standard libraries, corresponding to these source-files.  These are for C++ files the library
<code>libiostream.a</code> and for Objective C files the <code>libobjc.a</code> library.  If you want to disable this, deactivate the <em>Use standard libraries</em> checkbox. This adds also the
commandline option <var>-nostdlib</var> to GCC, that means, you must give the linker explicitly all of the standard libraries, which you need. This includes the <code>libgcc.a</code> and
<code>libc.a</code> libraries.  <p>

<A NAME="all dependencies in makefile">
<H4> all dependencies in makefile </H4></A><P>
When this is enabled, all internally stored dependencies for a project item are written to the makefile.  (See

<A HREF="#Write Makefile"> Write Makefile </A> ). You should disable this option, if you want to give another user the makefile of your project, and (s)he has a different directory structure.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="create backup files">
<H4> create backup files </H4></A><P>
Create backup files when saving. When it is enabled, RHIDE creates a backup of the file to save under the same name as the editing file, but the suffix is replaced with <code>.bak</code> <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="syntax highlighting">
<H4> syntax highlighting </H4></A><P>
Turn the Syntax highlight on or off. RHIDE automatically checks the suffix of the editing file to determine the correct syntax highlighting.  Currently this is supported only for C, C++, and Pascal
source files.  All other files are not specially highlighted.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="Use dual display">
<H4> Use dual display </H4></A><P>
Here is an very powerful option. If you have installed on your computer a secondary display (monochrome monitor) in addition to your VGA monitor, RHIDE can (when this option is enabled) switch to the
second monitor for it's output and you can see your program on the normal monitor.  <p>

If this option is enabled and you have not a secondary monitor installed, RHIDE will detect this and does not switch to it.  <p> <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="redirect stderr">
<H4> redirect stderr </H4></A><P>
Turn this on, if you want to redirect the output to stderr of your program to a window in the IDE. This is also needed, if you want to use the builtin analyzing of a call frame traceback, when your
program crashes.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="redirect stdout">
<H4> redirect stdout </H4></A><P>
Turn this option on, if you want to redirect the output to stdout from your program to a window in the IDE.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="show process information">
<H4> show process information </H4></A><P>
Turn this option on if you want to see which files are checked, when you do a make (See

<A HREF="#Make"> Make </A> ), and to see the commandlines how the compilers are started by RHIDE.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="show free memory">
<H4> show free memory </H4></A><P>
Turn this option on to show in the upper right corner of the screen a readout of the free memory of your system.  This shows both, the virtual and the physical free memory.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="No file caching">
<H4> No file caching </H4></A><P>
If this option is enabled, RHIDE does not use the internal caching of information about searching files and modification times. Use this only if you have problems with the automatic checking of
dependencies, because this slows down RHIDE.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="16 background colors">
<H4> 16 background colors </H4></A><P>
On EGA/VGA video cards it is possible to use 16 background colors instead of normal 8. This is done by telling the video card how to interpret the highest bit of the color attribute. If you enable
this, you can use up to 16 background colors, otherwise there are only 8 colors for the background available. To get blinking foreground colors, you must use a little trick. Enable at first this
option here. Then change the color attribute to highlight background color you want and then reset the '16 background colors' option.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="Show GDB commands">
<H4> Show GDB commands </H4></A><P>
When this option is enabled you can see in the GDB output window which commands are sent to the builtin GDB from RHIDE.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="Use no shadows">
<H4> Use no shadows </H4></A><P>
When this option is enabled RHIDE uses no shadows at all for the windows and dialogs and so on.  <p>

(See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) <p>

<A NAME="Save text palette">
<H4> Save text palette </H4></A><P>
When you debug a program, which modifies the palette when in text mode, you should enable this option.  <p>

<A NAME="Save project only when closing">
<H4> Save project only when closing </H4></A><P>
Enable this option only, when you get a system crash after starting your program and because of the use of disk cache the project, which RHIDE automatically saves before your program is run, is
corrupted.  <p>

<A NAME="Screen mode">
<H4> Screen mode </H4></A><P>
Here you can select the video mode. If you want to use a video mode other than the ones shown, you have to select the <var>User Mode</var> mode and type the value of this mode (see in the reference of
your video card) as a decimal or hexadecimal (preceeded by <code>0x</code>) number. But you can use only textmodes (modes with starting video ram address at <code>0xB800:0000</code>. For the numbers
of the videomodes refer to the documentation of your video card.  If you type an invalid videomode (RHIDE checks it), the 80x25-Mode will automatically selected.  <p>

I have tested all available text modes with my et4000-card, and they work. For some modes, (mostly every high resolution text mode) the mouse cursor is shown by my own routine.  That means that you
can use the mouse also in the high resolution text modes.  <p>

The syntax of the strings, which you can modify or add with the last menu-entries is any string followed by an optional modifier with the following meaning: <p>

<table border> <tr><td><samp>%d</samp><td> if you activate this option, you <em>must</em> enter an integer there

<tr><td><samp>%d?</samp><td> if you activate this option, you <em>can</em> enter an integer there

As an example: the string for the <samp>-O</samp> option is defined as <samp>-O%d?</samp> and the <samp>-d</samp> option (See

<A HREF="#Debugging"> Debugging </A> ) is defined as
 <samp>-d%s(MNDyrxjsLtfcSlgRJdkamp)</samp>
which means, the string after <samp>-d</samp> must be a combination of the characters in

This opens the INFO viewer. Many thanks at this point to Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET). He wrote the very good INFO viewer for use with RHIDE. This was also the most important reason for me to write
the documentation in Texinfo, because you have now an online help available with the produced INFO file <code>rhide.info</code>.  <p>

Pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> invokes the help system from everywhere.  For help on using the INFO viewer, press <kbd>F1</kbd> within the help window.  But the above things work only if you have correctly
installed the INFO files that come with RHIDE.  <p>

If you have installed the binary archive of RHIDE as described in the <code>readme.bin</code>, the INFO files are in <code>%DJDIR%/info</code>. If you have not modified your <code>djgpp.env</code>
file, this directory is searched for the INFO files.  <p>

But you can put the INFO files in any directory you want, if you add this directory to the %INFOPATH% variable in your <code>djgpp.env</code> file in the section for <code>info</code>.  <p>

<H3> 4.1 Selecting a window </H3></A><P>
To select a window you can do the following. If the window has a number, this is right on the top-frame, you can select this window by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> and this number (but only if the number
is a single digit).  Or you click anywhere in the window or on the frame of the window with your mouse.  <p>

<A NAME="How the editor works">
<H3> 4.2 How the editor works </H3></A><P>
This section should describe the work of the editor. But because the editor is now so complex and, not my own work, there is now separate documentation, See <A HREF="editor.html#Top">the "Top"
section of the "SET's editor"</A> for a detailed and better doc. But you can read also more from my doc, which describes the most common (for me) usage of the editor.

Here I describe most of the editor commands. If there is a key command like <kbd>Ctrl+Q+Y</kbd>, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd> simultaneously and after this press <kbd>Y</kbd>.  <p>

I strongly recommend not to use the technique by holding down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key when pressing the second key in such key combinations, because for instance when you press <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> and
then <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> you will be prompted if you want to interrupt RHIDE (because you pressed the interrupt key). But if you really want to use this methode, you should use the <code>-C</code>
commandline switch when starting RHIDE to disable the handling of <code>SIGINIT</code>.

To compile only a single file, you don't need to include it in a project.  You only have to open it and do a compile. If a file is in your project, you can compile it, if you are in its editor-window
or if you are in the project-window and this file is selected.  <p>

Warnings and errors from compiling a file are listed in the message-window.  If there are warnings or errors, you can jump to the corresponding source by hitting <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on this message. If
this file wasn't already opened, it will be opened.  <p>

<A NAME="Problems with automatic dependencies">
<H4> 4.3.1 Problems with automatic dependencies </H4></A><P>
Most checking of the dependencies works correctly, but there are some few situations, where this checking gets confused. The first results in the fact that I implemented a cache function for getting
the modification time of files, that means, most files are 'stat'ed only once, after starting RHIDE. But if someone modifies one of the files, which are in the cache, (this can be another program,
when you run RHIDE in a multitasking environment, such as Windows) or if you run your project and it modifies some of these files, the internal cache is after this not up to date.  <p>

Here is another situation. Your source files are not in the current directory. You have opened a source file for editing and successfully built your project. Now you leave RHIDE, because you want to
debug your program with <code>FSDB</code>, you copy the source file (in this case it is the file, which you have opened in the IDE) to the current directory. Now you debug it and there are some
errors. You restart RHIDE to make the changes in the file. The previously opened file will be opened automatically and you edit it. If you do now a <em>Make</em>, RHIDE tells you, that your project
is up to date, because it searches for source files at first in the current directory, and there is the unmodified file.  <p>

In this chapter I will give you for some special parts a more detailed description of what they do.  <p>

<A NAME="Project window">
<H3> 4.4 Project window </H3></A><P>
The project window shows you every file, which you have included in your project. Most time you work with RHIDE this window should be visible, but you can also close it (See

<A HREF="#Close"> Close </A> ).  <p>

</MENU>
<A NAME="Items of your project">
<H4> 4.4.1 Items of your project </H4></A><P>
The items in the project window, and therefore also in your project, are sorted in alphabetical order. This has the effect of faster finding an item and you can also move the selecting bar to a
specified item by typing the name of this item.  <p>

Normally, the alphabetic order of the project items causes no problems because the linker searches at first <em>every</em> object file for unresolved symbols before any library. The statement, the
the GNU linker is a one pass linker makes sense only for libraries, because they are checked only once for unresolved references. That means, if you include libraries in your project you must know
about the order, where this library is put on the command line when linking your program.  <p>

If you have problems with that order, or if you really want to have one object file (or library) before some others, you must rename them, to get the right position from the name.  <p>

<A NAME="Open a project item">
<H4> 4.4.2 Open a project item </H4></A><P>
To open an editor window with the selected item press either <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or <kbd>SPACE</kbd>. If there was already a window with this file opened on the desktop, this window will be selected.
This works only if the selected item has a known suffix (See

<A HREF="#Known suffixes"> Known suffixes </A> ). If the selected item is a project file, that project will be opened with the side effect that if you close this project, the previous one will be
reopened.  <p>

<A NAME="Dependencies of project item">
<H4> 4.4.3 Dependencies of project item </H4></A><P>
If you have compiled a file already in RHIDE, you bring up a list with all dependencies of that file. In this list the files are show by their basename followed by the directory and they are also
sorted in alphabetical order. From here you can also open an editor window with the selected dependency by pressing <kbd>SPACE</kbd> or <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on that item.  <p>

When you select this option the item is compiled only if it does not already exist. For most project items this is not usefull but if you have included in your project other projects which create a

From that list you can select exactly one type of the compiler, which is used to create your output file. Possible values are:

If you have selected above the User error checking, type here the program, which should check for errors and/or warnings.  What the external error checking program should do:

<ul>
<li>The program must take a filename as argument, which contain the output to stderr from the compiler (Error and warning messages)

<li>The program has to write to stdout the Warnings, Errors or messages in a special format.

followed by a space and a line number and "!Column" followed by a space and a coloumn number.  <p>

If "!Line" and/or "!Column" are not used they dafault to 0.  The next line contain the error text.  Example:

<pre>


!Error!File'test.c'!line17
This is a sample error message

WARNING: THE LIST OF VARIABLES AND STRINGFUNCTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW MIGHT NOT BE UPTODATE. IF YOU WANT TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT ALL FEATURES PLEASE LOOK IN THE SOURCES FOR RHIDE.  <p>

RHIDE uses for compiling, linking, and the other stages of generating a file also specs, like you can change in the local options for a project item (See

<A HREF="#Local options"> Local options </A> ). Here the specs, which are used currently:

<table border> <tr><td>$(RHIDE_COMPILE_C)<td> For compiling C source files

All of these specs have a default content in RHIDE, but they can be overwritten by setting the environment variable with the same name and any other contents.  <p>

<A NAME="Builtin variables">
<H3> 4.6 Builtin variables </H3></A><P>
This section describes, which variables can be used within RHIDE to get values from some of the configurations, which you have made inside RHIDE.  <p>

All of these variables are referenced by a name enclosed in parentheses preceeded by a dollar sign. Example: <samp>$(RHIDE_GCC)</samp>. You can overwrite any of the following variables, if you define
in your environment the same variable with any contents you want.  <p>

When RHIDE tries to get the contents of such a variable, it searches at first if it is found in it's internal database. If it was not found, the environment is checked for such a variable and if that
fails, the resulting value is the variable itself.  <p>

In addition to the use of variables, RHIDE has a limited ability of using string manipulating functions. I have implemented some of the functions, which are available with GNU make. They have the
same name and should work exactly like the GNU make counterpart.  <p>

<table border> <tr><td><samp>$(strip arg)</samp><td> This function removes any leading and trailing whitespace and converts all multispaces to single spaces from the (whitespace separated list)
<samp>arg</samp>.

<tr><td><samp>$(addsuffix arg1,arg2)</samp><td> These functions append on each argument from the whitespace separated list <samp>arg2</samp> the string <samp>arg1</samp>.

<tr><td><samp>$(addprefix arg1,arg2)</samp><td> This is the same as <samp>$(addsuffix arg1,arg2)</samp>, except that it puts the string <samp>arg1</samp> before each argument from <samp>arg2</samp>.

<tr><td><samp>$(notdir arg)</samp><td> This removes any directory part from the argument <samp>arg</samp>.

<tr><td><samp>$(dir)</samp><td> This extracts only the directory part from the argument <samp>arg</samp>. If there was no directory in <samp>arg</samp>, an empty string is returned. (The directory
contains also the drive letter, if there was one)

<A NAME="Change the defaults of RHIDE">
<H3> 4.7 Change the defaults of RHIDE </H3></A><P>
If you have special wishes for compiling your source files, you can configure for RHIDE mostly everything. For adding support for other than the builtin known file types (See

<A HREF="#Builtin variables"> Builtin variables </A> ). If you want to change the behavior of RHIDE for compiling all the known file types you should know at first really what you do. If you think,
this is a good idea or if you only want only check if it works you can do it.  <p>

Before RHIDE compiles any file (this includes also linking and building a library) it searches the environment for a variable after the following scheme: When compiling a file with suffix
<code>.c</code> to a file with suffix <code>.o</code> RHIDE checks for the variable $(RHIDE_COMPILE.c.o). If this variable is defined the contents of this variable is taken as the compile spec.  <p>

If you want to change the specs for linking you must take as destination suffix <code>.exe</code> or <code>.</code> and as source suffix the suffix of your object files. Example:

<pre>

$(RHIDE_COMPILE.o.)

</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="Message window">
<H3> 4.8 Message window </H3></A><P>
This window shows every time you compile a file the resulting messages, which GCC produces. These messages were converted in a special format to show them in the window. Some of the messages contain
a file eventually combined with a line number. If you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on such a message, the corresponding source line in the file will be highlighted and the window with this file will be
selected. If this file is not already on the desktop, it will be opened.  <p>

If the file, to which the messages refer, is already in the foreground you can see the selected source line for your messages directly on the screen.  <p>

<A NAME="Syntax highlighting">
<H3> 4.9 Syntax highlighting </H3></A><P>
Syntax highlighting is now supported directly by the editor. It should work in mostly every situation for all the supported types. Currently (in RHIDE) only the C/C++ style syntax highlight and the
Pascal style syntax highlight are supported.  <p>

With which style a file is highlighted is chosen by RHIDE by checking the suffix of the file and determining the file type from that suffix.  (See

<A NAME="Checking the dependencies">
<H3> 4.10 Checking the dependencies </H3></A><P>
This is one of the main parts of RHIDE. To speed up the work, I have added a cache for checking the modification time of a file and for finding a file (computing the full name of a file). But
sometimes the data in the cache isn't valid, especially when running under Windows. If you see this, you can clear the cache by leaving RHIDE and starting again.  <p>

If you didn't do any special things but have problems with it, please run RHIDE with the <samp>-df</samp> switch and try to find out, where the problem is and post it to me so I can fix it.  <p>

<A NAME="What is Turbo Vision">
<H3> 4.11 What is Turbo Vision </H3></A><P>
The Turbo Vision library is part of Turbo C++ version 3.1. I have ported this library to use with DJGPP because I think it is the most powerful text windowing library, which is available for MS-DOS.
With the help of this library you can write a front end application which looks very well and has an interface that is easy to use.  <p>

The Turbo Vision library is not only a window based text user interface, it is also a very good event handling mechanism. It supports the use of the mouse and keyboard with the ability of defining
and using of hotkeys.  That means, you can assign to some key or combinations of keys, which function should be executed.  <p>

The main parts of an application, which is using this library, are the desktop, the menu bar and the status line. The menu bar is usually shown as the topmost line of the screen. There are shown the
main parts of the pull down menus, from where you can select the most functions, which are implemented in an application.  <p>

To use the menu you can use the mouse as well the keyboard. With the mouse you can click every where on a menu entry and the corresponding function will be executed. There are some different actions,
which a menu entry can have. At first some of them, these are, for example, all the entries in the menu bar, open a submenu with more menu entries which are related to the name of this main entry.
And the others, most in such a submenu, execute a definite function of the application.  <p>

With the keyboard you can walk through the menu very simply. Press <kbd>F10</kbd> to activate the menu bar. In the pull down menus you can use the cursor keys to move the highlighted bar up and down
and with the cursor right and left keys you can switch to next or previous menu. With the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key you activate the function, which corresponds to this entry. If this was a submenu, which
is indicated with a symbol like a small right arrow, this will be opened.  <p>

If you walk through the menu with the cursor keys or the mouse (hold the left mouse button down and move the mouse) in the status line will be shown for each entry a short hint for the function of
this menu entry.  <p>

<A NAME="How the dialogs work">
<H3> 4.12 How the dialogs work </H3></A><P>
In a dialog, like the file open dialog, are many things which you can select or where you can type in some data. At first some general functions. If you press <kbd>ESC</kbd> the dialog will be closed
and nothing will be changed. The same can be done with the mouse by clicking on the close symbol (this is the small symbol on upper left frame of the dialog).  <p>

In the next paragraphs I will describe the most used elements of a dialog.  For selecting each element of a dialog you can use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to select the next element in the dialog or the
<kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> key, to select the previous element.  <p>

A button is a rectangle with some text on it. If you activate such a button a specified action is executed. To select a button you can use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, until the button is specially
highlighted and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> then. Most times a character of the text on this button has a different color. So you can press <kbd>Alt</kbd> plus this character to activate the button. With
the mouse you can simply click on a button to activate it.  <p>

A Listbox is a collection of some strings in one or more columns and rows as needed. The project window (See

<A HREF="#Project window"> Project window </A> ) is such a Listbox with the names of the project items. You can use the cursor keys to move the focus bar in the list, or if it is a sorted Listbox,
you can also type some characters and the focus will move to the item, which starts with these characters. To select a item in a list box, press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> or <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or double click
with mouse on it.  <p>

In an input line you can type some text which can be edited with the usual editing keys.  <p>

A checkbox is a collection of options, which can be turned on or off.  Each option has in front of it a small indicator, if it is turned on (an X is shown) or not (the X is not shown). To toggle such
an option, use the cursor keys to move the focus to the option you want and press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> or, if a character in an option string is highlighted you can press this key and the option will be
turned on or off or click with the mouse on the option.  <p>

Radiobuttons are similar to Checkboxes, but there you can select only one of all the shown options.  <p>

<A NAME="Defining macros">

<A NAME="The INFO Viewer">
<H3> 4.14 The INFO Viewer </H3></A><P>
The integrated help system of RHIDE is based on the INFO Viewer written by <a href="mailto:ice@inti.edu.ar">Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET)</a>. It gives you access to all the INFO files which you have
installed in the correct directories as is done for <code>info.exe</code>.  <p>

To get help about the INFO Viewer hit <kbd>F1</kbd> when the help-window is opened or follow this link to see

<B>Section Top in documentation for The Info Viewer</B> .  <p>

In addition to getting help with this system you can also copy text from the help screen to the clipboard. This is useful if you want for instance to copy an example from the libc reference in your
program. This feature is not so powerful as in the editor, but it is good enough. To mark some text use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> and cursor keys and copy the selected text with <kbd>Ctrl+Ins</kbd> to the
clipboard.  <p>

In RHIDE you have also the possibility to get help about a specific function. Currently this works only for functions, which are documented in the libc reference. For doing this, move the cursor to
the function and hit <kbd>Ctrl+F1</kbd> or click with the right button of the mouse on that word.  <p>

<A NAME="RCS and RHIDE">
<H3> 4.15 RCS and RHIDE </H3></A><P>
RHIDE knows a little bit about RCS, the Revision Control System. Since RCS is available also for DJGPP I enabled now some features to use RHIDE also on packages which use RCS.  <p>

RHIDE can handle RCS files in the way, that it searches for a checked in source file if the normal source file was not found. The complicatest part here was to determin the correct RCS file name from
the source name. (Especially under DJGPP this is a problem since under raw DOS it is not possible to use names like 'foo.c,v').  <p>

So I decided to use the external program <code>rlog</code> which comes with the RCS package to determine the actual correct RCS source name. I did so because the DJGPP implementation knows enough
about the DOS limitation and how to solve them.  <p>

This help here is not ment to be a RCS introduction. If you don't know what RCS is or what can be done with it, please look in the manuals wich come with RCS.  <p>

Here now what RHIDE knows about the RCS files. If a source file was not found, it's RCS name is computed with the spec <samp>$(RHIDE_RLOG)</samp> which defaults to <samp>$(shell rlog -R
$(rlog_arg))</samp> where <samp>$(rlog_arg)</samp> is substituted at runtime with the actual wanted source file.  <p>

This spec can be overwritten to speed it up. An example for this can be found in the distributed sample environment file <code>rhide_.env</code>.  <p>

When RHIDE only wants to compile the file or only to get the modification time it is temporary checked out (without locking it) and after the needed operation (compiling) it is removed (for checking
the modification time it is not checked out, but the time form the RCS file is taken).  <p>

If you want to open that file for editing the same is done but now it is checked out with setting a lock and it is not checked in after closing the window. The spec for checking the file out is
<samp>$(RHIDE_CO)</samp> which can be overwritten also and it defaults to <samp>$(shell co -q $(co_arg))</samp> where the switch <samp>-l</samp> is added when it is checked out for edititing
otherwise <samp>$(co_arg)</samp> is substituted at runtime only with the wanted source file.  <p>

<A NAME="Debugging with RHIDE"> <CENTER>
<H2> 5. Debugging with RHIDE </H2></A><P>
</CENTER>
For debugging your programs you need now no external debugger, because RHIDE has one integrated. The integrated debugger is not code which I have written, but it is GDB 4.16, which is linked in RHIDE.
<p>

Because RHIDE uses a special method to communicate with GDB it is currently not possible to use all of the features, which GDB has. I have implemented at this time the most important functions, which
are needed to debug your program. So it is not possible to give GDB the same commands as when running GDB stand alone. That means, if you need any very special feature of GDB you must run GDB.  <p>

The integrated debugger is a real source level debugger like GDB. If you step through your program you will see every time exactly where in the sources you are. But to use the ability to debug your
program needs, that you have compiled your source files with debugging information and these symbols must not have been stripped from the executable.  <p>

<A NAME="Limitations of the integrated debugger">
<H3> 5.1 Limitations of the integrated debugger </H3></A><P>
Because the integrated debugger is GDB, you will have all the limitations which GDB has in addition to well known DJGPP and/or MS-DOS limitations.  Here is a (not complete) list of known misfeatures:

<ul>
<li>Signals are not correctly handled every time by distinguishing between the debuggee and RHIDE

<li>Remote debugging is NOT supported

<li>Debugging of graphic programs may work or not depending on the software you are using. Currently only the VESA modes and the standard VGA graphic modes are supported.

<li>When using the integrated debugger under Windows 3.1x (in Windows 95 there is no such limitation) the number of breakpoints is limited to 3, because you can use there only hardware breakpoints.
The i386 supports only 4 hardware breakpoints and 1 is needed for internal use.  This is a common problem for all DJGPP debuggers. (Try to use FSDB with more than 3 breakpoints under Windows 3.1x)

<li>Sometimes the source line, which is shown by RHIDE in assuming that the execution is there, is not correct. But this is NOT a bug of RHIDE and NOT of GDB. This is a bug in GCC which produces
wrong line number information in the object files. Here is a very simple test program, with which you can see this problem.

<pre>

     /* This is an example, that GCC produces wrong line number
        information for code which is optimized out. (compile this
        with -O) */
     
     int a = 1;
     int b = 2;
     
     int main()
     {
       if (a == b) return 0;
       if ((a + 1) == b) return 1;
       return 0; /* The debugger should never come here,
                    but it comes */
     }

</pre>
</ul>
<A NAME="Dual display debugging">
<H3> 5.2 Dual display debugging </H3></A><P>
RHIDE supports now also to use an installed dual display. This is when you have installed in addition to your VGA card a monochrome display card together with a monitor. RHIDE checks this by asking
the BIOS if it is present and if this is true and the option is enabled (See

<A HREF="#Preferences"> Preferences </A> ) then RHIDE switches automatically to the secondary display when debugging and your program will run on the primary display.  <p>

With this debugging technique you will get the best debugging results especially when debugging graphics programs.  <p>

To use the dual display with RHGDB use the <samp>-D</samp> switch for RHGDB.  <p>

<A NAME="Using the integrated debugger">
<H3> 5.3 Using the integrated debugger </H3></A><P>
If you are familiar with Borland's debugger, you will see, that most of the functions of that debugger are implemented in the same or in a similar way (this includes the key bindings).  <p>

<p>

</MENU>
<A NAME="Stepping through the source code">
<H4> 5.3.1 Stepping through the source code </H4></A><P>
For stepping through your code, there are three ways. This is at first the Step-function <kbd>F8</kbd>. With this you execute a complete source line. If there is a function call at the current
execution point, this function is called without debugging it. This technique is the same like the <samp>next</samp>-command from GDB.  <p>

The next way is the Trace-function.  It is like the Step-function, <kbd>F7</kbd>, except that if there is a function call at the current execution point, you will go into this function when there is
debugging information for that function available.  This technique is the same as the <samp>step</samp>-command from GDB.  <p>

And the third way is the Goto-Cursor-function. For this, move the cursor to the line in your source code and press <kbd>F4</kbd>. Now the execution of your program is continued until it comes to that
line. Sometimes you will get an error message, that for the specified line is no code generated.  This comes from the optimization of your code by GCC. In this case try a line below or above.  <p>

<A NAME="Evaluating the contents of variables">
<H4> 5.3.2 Evaluating the contents of variables </H4></A><P>
You can evaluate also the the contents of variables, when your program has been started. For this you can press <kbd>Ctrl+F4</kbd> and you will see a dialog, where you can type in the expression to
evaluate, a line with the result and a line, where you can give the expression a new value. If you have pressed this in an editor window, RHIDE tries to find the word under the cursor and copies this
as default in the expression input line. To get the contents of this expression you have to press the <em>Evaluate</em>-button.  <p>

If the expression could not be evaluated so it is shown in the result line.  For the exact syntax of getting the contents of an expression see

<B>Section Expressions in documentation for gdb</B> . You can also show the value of the expression in several formats, see

<B>Section Output Formats in documentation for gdb</B> .  <p>

In addition to the functionality of the Borland debuggers, GDB (and of course also RHIDE) can evaluate the result of function calls. If you have, for example, in your debugged program a function
<pre>

     int foo(int arg1)
     {
     /* do something and return a value */
     }

</pre>
defined, you can type in the expression input line
<pre>

     foo(16)

</pre>
and you will get as result, what the function would return, if it is called with the argument <code>16</code>. As arguments you can also use any known variable or complex expressions.  <p>

A known limitation is, that the expressions are NOT checked for validity.  That means, you can produce any exception there, which will terminate your program. As an example type in the expression
input line
<pre>

3/0

</pre>
And, of course, you cannot assign to a function call a new value.  <p>

As an special side effect you can use this also as a calculator. You can evaluate any trivial or complex expression and this is also available, if you haven't started the integrated debugger.  <p>

<A NAME="Watching the contents of variables">
<H4> 5.3.3 Watching the contents of variables </H4></A><P>
In addition to a single look at the contents of a variable, you can add the variable to a list which is updated after each debugger step and is shown in the watching window. For this function you can
use the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl+F7</kbd>.  <p>

Within the watch window you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on an expression to change that expression (NOT the contents of that expression) or you can press <kbd>Del</kbd> to remove the variable from the
watch window.  <p>

<A NAME="Problems with C++ programs">
<H3> 5.4 Problems with C++ programs </H3></A><P>
Because GDB cannot handle correctly C++ debugging information when it is generated as COFF debugging information (with stabs debugging information there is no such limitation and you can skip reading
more) you will have many problems when debugging C++ programs to get the contents of a variable when it is a member of a class. Because GDB does not detect, that your program is a C++ program, it
sees it as a normal C program and so GDB does nothing know about classes and all what have to do with it.  <p>

For accessing the member of a baseclass you must do some tricks. Let me explain it on an example:

<pre>

     class A
     {
     public:
       int a;
     };
     
     class B : public A
     {
     public:
       void test();
     };
     
     void B::test()
     {
       fprintf(stdout,"%d\n",a);
     }

</pre>
If you debug the program in the function <code>B::test()</code> and you want to get the contents of the member <code>a</code>, you have to access it with <code>this->A.a</code> !!! That means: At
first you must access all members with the implicit <code>this</code> variable and at second you must give all baseclasses until that, where the member was declared.  <p>

<A NAME="Using Breakpoints">
<H3> 5.5 Using Breakpoints </H3></A><P>
Breakpoints are a very useful thing when debugging a program. You can set a breakpoint at any location of your program and run it. It will be automatically stopped, if the program execution reaches
the breakpoint.

<p>

</MENU>
<A NAME="Setting a breakpoint">
<H4> 5.5.1 Setting a breakpoint </H4></A><P>
For setting a breakpoint there are two different ways. The first is by setting a breakpoint at any line by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+F8</kbd>. You will see, that there is a breakpoint set, that this line is
shown in another color. If you hit <kbd>Ctrl+F8</kbd> on a line, which has already a breakpoint, the breakpoint at this line is removed.  <p>

<A NAME="Modifying and setting a breakpoint">
<H4> 5.5.2 Modifying and setting a breakpoint </H4></A><P>
The second way is by setting a breakpoint with the breakpoint dialog which is selectable only from the menu. There you will see any breakpoint for your program. These breakpoints can be modified now
in many things.  In this dialog you can enable/disable a breakpoint. This is not the same as deleting and resetting it. If you disable a breakpoint, it is stored internally but it is not used. If you
enable it again all the settings for that breakpoint, which you have already made, are remembered.  <p>

In the breakpoint dialog you can also set or delete a breakpoint with the given buttons. If you want to set a new breakpoint, use the New-Button. Then you will get a dialog which you also get when you
press the Modify-Button. In this dialog you can change many things of the breakpoint.  <p>

In this dialog is the only point for setting a breakpoint at a specified function. For doing this you must set at first the type of the breakpoint to Function. Then you can type in the function input
line the name of the function or hit <kbd>Ctrl+F1</kbd> to get a list of functions which are available from where you can select one with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  <p>

For setting a breakpoint at a specified line, set the breakpoint type to Line and type in the filename and the linenumber.  <p>

The next what you can modify on a breakpoint is a condition. That means that the breakpoint should stop your program only, if the condition is true. Write the condition in the programming language of
your source file and you can use any accessible variable and you can call also functions of the debugged program. For other information about the syntax see

<B>Section Conditions in documentation for gdb</B> .  <p>

And at last you can give your breakpoints also a count. A breakpoint count is a number, how often this breakpoint is ignored. That means, if you type there, for example, <kbd>10</kbd>, then the RHIDE
stops the execution of the program only, if it comes to that point the tenth time. WARNING: This count is set by RHIDE only once. After the breakpoint is really hit, from now on the breakpoint stops
your program every time, the breakpoint is reached.  <p>

<A NAME="Problems with breakpoints">
<H4> 5.5.3 Problems with breakpoints </H4></A><P>
Currently there is a big problem, when you have set a breakpoint at a line (not at a function) of your program and you edit now the source code. If you insert or delete some lines the breakpoints,
which are set at lines after or at the modified lines are NOT updated to the correct line number.

<A NAME="Debugging with RHGDB"> <CENTER>
<H2> 6. Debugging with RHGDB </H2></A><P>
</CENTER>
In addition to RHIDE, which has an integrated debugger, there is also a stand-alone debugger called RHGDB. (The name comes from my initials and GDB) <p>

RHGDB has the same abilities as RHIDE for debugging your program. But it has no editor. The source files are shown in read only windows where you can move the cursor and other things (except editing)
like in RHIDE.  <p>

The menu tree is analog of RHIDE's but (of course) it has not all the menu entries of RHIDE, because RHGDB should be used only for debugging and nothing else.  <p>

I have written it to debug DJGPP programs, for which there is no RHIDE project file available but the program has debugging information and, if you are short of memory, it is much smaller than RHIDE.
<p>

The syntax for using RHGDB is very simple. Run it with your program as the first argument followed by any argument, which should be passed to your program.  <p>

RHGDB saves and reads the options from files with the suffix <code>.rgd</code>.  This is done automatically when you run RHGDB with your program as argument by searching a file with the same basename
of your program and the suffix <code>.rgd</code> and in this file the options are also automatically stored, when you exit RHGDB.  <p>

Alternatively you can also save/read the options from within RHIDE by selecting the corresponding menu entries from the Options menu.  <p>

To use the the "Dual display debugging" feature of RHGDB you must give on commandline the <samp>-D</samp> switch.  <p>

<A NAME="Some FAQs"> <CENTER>
<H2> 7. Some FAQs </H2></A><P>
</CENTER>
<em><strong>Question</strong>: I have enabled the <samp>Use tabs</samp> option, but if I move the cursor through that tab, it seems, that RHIDE uses spaces </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>:This behavior cannot (currently) be changed. Even when you have enabled the use of real tabs (characters with the code 9), the cursor is moved as if there are spaces.  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: Are there any sample project files, to show how RHIDE works? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>:The sources of RHIDE include many project files to rebuild at least RHIDE with itself and many others.  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I have written some libraries. How can I use them in a project? </em> <p>
<em><strong>Question</strong>: How I can use a library, which I have? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>: There are some different ways to do this. On the one side you can include them directly in the project with the <em>Add to project item</em> function (See

<A HREF="#Add item"> Add item </A> ). But if they are not in the current directory, you must also set the library search path to the directory, where they are. (See

<A HREF="#Library directories"> Library directories </A> ). The other variant is to include them in the list of libraries. (See

<A HREF="#Libraries"> Libraries </A> ) <p>

If this library is created with RHIDE, that means you have a project file for building this library you can also simply include that project file in your project. For examples, look at the RHIDE
sources in the project file for RHIDE.  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I have a directory, where all my include files are. Can I setup RHIDE to have this directory every time in the include search path, when creating a new project? </em>
<p>
<em><strong>Question</strong>: I prefer the 80x28 video mode over the default 80x25 mode. How I can turn this mode on by default for all newly created project files? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>: You can create a default project file. From this file RHIDE reads all the options, if it creates a new project. The default project must have the same basename as the
executable of RHIDE and must be located in the same directory.  <p>

The creation of such a default project file is very simple. Change to the directory, where <code>rhide.exe</code> is located and run there
<pre>

     rhide rhide

</pre>
Now make any changes in the options which you want to have as default for all newly created projects. This includes also settings in the various search paths. If you are ready, exit RHIDE and this
project file will be your default project file.  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I know, that I can create a default project file. Can I create and use more than one? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>:Since DJGPP supports a quasi-Unix-like link for executables, you can create such a link also for RHIDE. As an example I will create a link to <code>rhide.exe</code> with the
name <code>myrhide.exe</code>. At first I have to create the new file.
<pre>

     stubify -g myrhide.exe

</pre>
Now I must tell <code>myrhide.exe</code> which program it really should run.
<pre>

     stubedit myrhide.exe runfile=rhide

</pre>
Thats all. Or, if you have installed the GNU fileutils, you can use also now the <code>ln.exe</code> program to create the link:
<pre>

     ln -s rhide.exe myrhide.exe

</pre>
<p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I don't want to type every time I start RHIDE the commandline <var>-L de</var> to use the German user interface. Is there any better way? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>: Create an environment variable <var>LANGUAGE</var> with your preferred language like
<pre>

     set LANGUAGE=de

</pre>
and your problem is solved.  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I have 4 Mb RAM in my computer and every time, when I compile large files with optimizations enabled, my hard disk is working very hard. </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>:Buy more RAM!  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I heard something about a newer version RHIDE. From where I can get exact information about this? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>: See <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~rho/rhide.html">at the RHIDE home page</a>..  (valid until at least 30. Sepetember 1997) This page contains the latest news and the
latest version of RHIDE.  <p>

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it. Can you help me? </em> <p>
<hr>
<strong>Answer</strong>: Send it to me, so I can spend more time for developing RHIDE. My Address is:

<em><strong>Question</strong>: I think, I found a bug in RHIDE. How can I report it? </em> <p>

<strong>Answer</strong>:At first try for your own to solve the problem by checking the documentation.  <p>

If the bug is releated to the editor (some keys do not work, autoindenting is not like you expect, program creash after some special editing ....) please send them to
<a href="mailto:ice@inti.edu.ar">Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET)</a>, because he is the author of the in RHIDE integrated editor.  <p>

See at <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~rho/rhide.html">the RHIDE home page</a>.  (valid until at least 30. September 1997), if this problem was already reported by other users. As the next ask
the problem in the news group <a href="news:comp.os.msdos.djgpp">comp.os.msdos.djgpp</a>, because there may be some other people with the same problem, and they can give you an answer or I, because I
read this group also.  <p>

Linux users should post thier problems in the linux group. To make sure that I will read it there also, please include in the subject anywhere the word RHIDE so I will find it, because I do not read
any article there because the group is too heavily used. Currently I do only a subject search for the word RHIDE and if not found I mark the group as readed by me. Sorry for this, but compared with
the very good comp.os.msdos.djgpp group the linux groups are too large for seriously diskussion (at least for me).  <p>

If this don't help you, do the following:

<blockquote>
     Try to reproduce the error with the smallest possible project or source file. Run RHIDE with all debugging options enabled and redirect the printed output to a file. (See

     <A HREF="#Debugging RHIDE"> Debugging RHIDE </A> ) Send me this file and a detailed as possible description of the problem and include in your report the exact version of RHIDE you are using.
     <p>

     The exact version is shown in the About-Dialog and means the version number together with the build date.


</blockquote>
<p>

And a last note. If I get bug reports or questions or problems with RHIDE which I think that they are of common interest be warned that I bounce them simply to the news groups because at this time it
is impossible for me to answer all the mails I get. So the best is to post the questions and/or problems only in the news groups.  <p>
