This is a libg++ addon for libstdc++ 2.8.1.1. It is needed only if
your applications depend on libg++ and you cannot easily remove the
dependency on libg++. The standalone libg++ is no longer needed.  Note
that this package is no longer being maintained.

To install, move all the files in this directory into the directory
where you unpacked libstdc++ version 2.8.1.1 (or unpacked version
2.8.0 and applied the diff to convert it to version 2.8.1.1).  Then
you can configure/build/check/install libstdc++ normally. Now it will
include libg++.
