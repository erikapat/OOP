This file will give you some hints to the linux port
of RHIDE.

It is currently available ONLY on my website and NOT
via FTP. The main URL for RHIDE is

http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~rho/rhide.html

and specific to the linux RHIDE you can use also

http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~rho/rhide-linux.html

I will place there the sources and also ready binaries.
After seeing the problems with shared linked binaries,
I include in the bin archive now only static linked 
binaries.

Installing RHIDE
================

The binary archive has all the RHIDE files stored
in a subdirectoy called rhide-?.??. In this directory
is also a installation script, which installs the
the binaries and other needed files on your system.
Look at INSTALL.LINUX for additional options to that
script.

Documentation about RHIDE
=========================
The doc (which is also the core of the integrated
help system) is in INFO format and is also part
of the binary distribution. Because of missing time
I haven't updated it yet to the linux version, so
many things there are DJGPP specific (especially
the directory and insatllation descriptions). But
the other things about the functionality can be read
and used also on linux.

Linux specific remarks
======================

Because RHIDE was designed originaly for DJGPP many
things in RHIDE are specifiy for that environment.
I have tried to make it as much as possible unix-like,
but not all is fineshed yet.

The main differences (and difficulties when porting
RHIDE to linux) is all the stuff which depends on
the hardware. These are the keyboard, the screen and
the mouse.

Since a normal user under linux has no direct access
to the hardware you will get the best results with
RHIDE (speed, look and feel ...) only when you run
RHIDE as root or install it as root with the setuid
bit set. In that case RHIDE will use root rights only
until it has accessed the screen, then it will use
the real user id for any other things.

But you can make RHIDE also as a setgid program, when
you create a new group and allow this group rw permissions
to the /dev/vcsa.. devices. I have written a small
script, which setup the correct things for that. Look
at VCSA.SH.

Other known problems:
  - RHIDE knows currently nothing about any installed fonts.
    It uses at any time the IBM PC charset.


Because I found until now no documentation about a
standard directory tree for such a package like RHIDE,
I hope I made a tree which is acceptable. After a hint
of a first RHIDE tester on linux, I made now a directory
tree for RHIDE, where all is placed in one directory,
called after the RHIDE version, as writing this it is

rhide-1.3


Running RHIDE in a xterm
========================

I had many problems, when running RHIDE in a xterm. I don't
know what is wrong (either the terminfo file for the xterm
or my X setup) but I think it is the terminfo file.

At first I recommend to run RHIDE in a rxvt because of a better
color support. In a standard xterm RHIDE will use only black
and white.
For the keys I have patched my xterm-color terminfo file to
have the keysequences the same as generated. For instance there
was a difference in the cursor key sequences. In the terminfo
file, there was \EOA for the cursor up key, but \E[A is generated.
So I have changed simply most of the \EO to \E[ and after this
most of the keys worked.


Problems with the editor
========================

Since the editor was designed to be used on DJGPP, it was written
in the hardly assumption, that the text files are in MS-DOS style
(CR/LF). I have tried to make it now working also on files from
the unix world by accepting only LF as line terminator, but
not all is working correct (you can see this when you select
text, use autoindent and so on), but I think for a first try to
RHIDE you can live with it.

Reporting bugs
==============

Please do use the bug-report feature of RHIDE because it contains at
least the most important information for me about your system.
Since the newsgroup comp.os.linux.misc is so huge, I do not read it
regulary. You can post it there to get also help from others but please
send also a CC to me.
But before doing so, please remember at first the above mentioned
problems, because they are known to me and they need not to be reported
to me.

      Have fun with RHIDE,
