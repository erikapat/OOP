DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUTS FOR MS-DOS
----------------------------------
Microsoft distributes Dvorak keyboard layouts that make the most 
frequently typed characters on a keyboard more accessible to people 
who have difficulty using the standard "QWERTY" layout. There are 
three Dvorak layouts: one for two-handed users, one for people who 
type only with their left hand, and one for people who type only 
with their right hand. The left or right hand keyboard layouts can 
also be used by people who type with a wand.

The MS-DOS Supplemental Disk includes the DVORAK.SYS file, which 
provides three new keyboard layouts for Microsoft MS-DOS.

This document explains how to install these layouts and restore 
your original layout. It also provides illustrations of the layouts.

WHAT IS A KEYBOARD LAYOUT?
--------------------------
A keyboard layout is a map or a definition of how keys are laid 
out on your keyboard. The keyboard layout you use is determined 
by software in your computer. The letters on your keys indicate 
the standard layout for your keyboard. There are many different 
keyboard layouts in use throughout the world. The one you ordinarily 
use depends on the country you are in or the language you use.

DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUTS
-----------------------
Dvorak keyboard layouts are based on designs created by August 
Dvorak, a professor at the University of Washington during the 
1930s and 1940s. Dr. Dvorak studied the way people type standard 
English, and determined the most common letter combinations. He 
then designed new keyboard layouts to speed up typing and reduce 
fatigue. These layouts, now called Dvorak or simplified keyboards, 
were initially developed for two-handed typists. Following World 
War II, Dvorak layouts were developed for typists who use the right 
or left hand alone.

INSTALLING A DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUT FOR MS-DOS
----------------------------------------------
The MS-DOS Supplemental Disk provides the DVORAK.SYS file. This 
file supports the Dvorak keyboard layouts for two-handed and 
single-handed typists who use MS-DOS 6.22.

To install a United States (U.S.) Dvorak keyboard layout for MS-DOS:

1. Run the Setup program included with the Supplemental disk files.
   For example, if your Supplemental disk files are on a floppy
   disk for drive A, insert the disk in drive A, and change to
   that drive by typing the following at the command prompt:

   A:

   To run the Setup program, you need to specify the drive and directory
   to which you want to install the files. For example, if you want to
   install the files on drive C in a directory called SUPP, type
   the following at the command prompt:

   SETUP C:\SUPP

   Follow the instructions on your screen.

2. Copy the DVORAK.SYS file to the directory that contains your
   MS-DOS files. For example, if the file is in C:\SUPP and your
   MS-DOS files are contained in C:\DOS, type the following at
   the command prompt:

   COPY C:\SUPP\DVORAK.SYS C:\DOS\DVORAK.SYS
   
3. To begin using one of the new keyboard layouts, type the 
   appropriate command (as shown in the table below) at the MS-DOS 
   command prompt and press ENTER.
        
   Keyboard Layout          Command
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Two-handed Dvorak        KEYB DV,,C:\DOS\DVORAK.SYS

   Right-handed Dvorak      KEYB RH,,C:\DOS\DVORAK.SYS

   Left-handed Dvorak       KEYB LH,,C:\DOS\DVORAK.SYS

To load one of these keyboard layouts automatically when your 
computer starts, include the appropriate KEYB command in your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The KEYB command should be placed after a 
PATH command that includes your MS-DOS directory. If your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file includes the win or dosshell command, make 
sure the KEYB command comes before the WIN or DOSSHELL command.

Once you have loaded one of the Dvorak layouts, you can easily 
switch between the Dvorak layout and the U.S. standard layout.

* To switch back to the U.S. standard layout, press CTRL+ALT+F1.

* To switch to the Dvorak layout, press CTRL+ALT+F2.

* To disable the United States (U.S.) Dvorak keyboard layout 
  for MS-DOS

* To disable the United States (U.S.) Dvorak keyboard layout 
  for MS-DOS, delete the line with the KEYB command from your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUTS FOR WINDOWS
-----------------------------------
Microsoft also provides Dvorak keyboard layouts for Microsoft 
Windows, Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft 
Windows NT. Windows includes the Dvorak keyboard layout for 
two-handed typists. The Dvorak layouts for single-handed typists 
are available on the GA0650.ZIP file. If you have a modem, 
you can download the GA0650.ZIP file from network services, 
including the following:

* CompuServe

* GEnie

* Microsoft OnLine

* Microsoft Download Service (MSDL), which you can reach in the
  United States by calling (206) 936-6735 or in Canada by calling 
  (416) 507-3022. Use a baud rate of 1200, 2400, or 9600, no parity bit, 
  8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. The file containing the layouts on 
  MSDL is named GA0650.EXE.

* Various user-group bulletin boards (such as the bulletin-board 
  services on the Association of PC User Groups network)

Users within the United States who do not have a modem can order 
application note GA0650 by calling Microsoft Product Support 
Services at (206) 637-7098 or (206) 635-4948 (text telephone).

NOTE: If you use MS-DOS-based applications with Windows, you must 
install the Dvorak layouts for MS-DOS to get Dvorak support for 
those applications.
