This is the directory file `dir' a.k.a. `DIR', which contains the
  topmost node of the Info hierarchy.
This particular dir file is the minimal one, which is only good for
  reading the documenation of the Texinfo programs.  It is made
  available for those who don't have DJGPP installed (DJGPP comes with
  a larger `DIR' file).


File: dir,	Node: Top,	This is the top of the INFO tree.

This is the Info main menu (aka directory node).
A few useful Info commands:

  `q'    quits;
  SPC    (or PgDn) scrolls forward;
  BS     (or PgUp) scrolls backward;
  TAB    tabs to next hypertext link (reference/menu item);
  RET    goes to hypertext link under cursor;
  `l'    (that's a lower-case `ell') returns to last section;
  `?'    lists all Info commands;
  `h'    starts the Info tutorial;
  `mTexinfo RET' visits the Texinfo manual, etc.

  To choose from a menu, either TAB there and press RET, or move the
  cursor to the line and press `m RET'.
