; The following macros are designed for the Autoindent+Unindent mode.
; \n is new line.
; \b is backspace.
; @0 is the position where the cursor is positioned after the insertion
; @1 is memorized in ^Q7 (or Alt7)
; @2 is memorized in ^Q8 (or Alt8)
; @3 is memorized in ^Q9 (or Alt9)
; Don't put only @ at the end of the string :-).
;
;   The Mode keyword indicates the mode of the editor when the macro is
; triggered, each mode can be 0 or 1:
; Overwrite, Autoindent, Use Tabs, Persistent blocks, Inteligent C indent
; For example: Mode: 0,1,0,1,0
; Indicates: No overwrite, autoindent, don't use real tabs, the blocks are
; persistent and don't be smart when indenting.
;   The Mode keyword can't be omitted.
